# About Gregory

I illustrate my passion for video games, computers, 
and software as a whole through the development, modification, 
and release of various platforms and projects that engage my users 
in a fun and proactvice way. My favorite color is lime green.

My first programming experience began in 2019 when I developed 
my first discord bot for servers that I privately managed. Falling 
in love with programming, and having experience in various block editors 
like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), it foreshadowed a long, prosperous, and active path 
of software development for me at the age of 12. I worked on Minecraft 
plugins and modifications during my middle school and early high school years, 
while also having some other projects such as [Terminal Miner](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/Terminal-Miner), the first 
game I ever made in C++. I work in all kinds of programming and video game
design, such as with [Unreal Engine](https://unrealengine.com), [KorGE](https://korge.org),
and many more.

I've developed many different kinds of things, which began from my creating of discord bots into the development of Minecraft plugins. Slowly, I became immersed within rich developer culture, and continue to consume feedback at a high standard to ensure quality products.
