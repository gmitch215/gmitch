# About Gregory

I illustrate my passion for video games, computers, 
and software as a whole through the development, modification, 
and release of various platforms and projects that engage my users 
in a fun and proactvice way. My favorite color is lime green.

My first real programming experience began in 2019 when I developed my first discord bot for servers that I privately managed. Falling in love with programming, and having experience in various block editors like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), it foreshadowed a long, prosperous, and active path of software development for me at the age of 11. I did some more JavaScript stuff with my first node module, [nodebook](https://nodebook.js.org), before working on Minecraft plugins and modifications during my middle school and early high school years. 

[Terminal Miner](https://github.com/gmitch215/Terminal-Miner), the first  game I ever made in C++, is when I started branching out into all different kinds of programming languages.

I work in all kinds of programming and video game design, such as with [Unreal Engine](https://unrealengine.com), [KorGE](https://korge.org), and many more. This began with my first video game company, [Calculus Games](https://calcugames.xyz).

I've developed many different kinds of things, which began from my creating of discord bots into the development of Minecraft plugins. Slowly, I became immersed within rich developer culture, and continue to consume feedback at a high standard to ensure quality products.
